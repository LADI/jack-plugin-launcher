LADI core module complements the C runtime with few basic building blocks
that are used almost everywhere in the LADI system (jackdbus, a2jmidid, ladish, etc).

 * klist.h - Linked list header implementation borrowed from Linux kernel
 * catdup.h - String concatenation into newly allocated buffer
 * file.h - File helpers

The in-tree build system is used only for rendering documetnation.
The C files are to be built by the build system of project using them
(via submodule or direct merge).
