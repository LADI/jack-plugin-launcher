/**
@mainpage LADI core module

LADI core module complements the C runtime with few basic building blocks
that are used almost everywhere in the LADI system (jackdbus, a2jmidid, ladish, etc).

 - klist.h - Linked list header implementation borrowed from Linux kernel
 - catdup.h - String concatenation into newly allocated buffer
 - file.h - File helpers
